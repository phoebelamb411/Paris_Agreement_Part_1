The scenario in which country-reported data (CRF, BUR, UNFCCC) is prioritized over third-party data (CDIAC, FAO, Andrew, EDGAR, BP) is used on Climate Watch. The data resolves the main IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) 2006 categories. Subsector data for Energy, Industrial Processes, Agriculture and Waste is available for CO2, CH4, and N2O. Due to data availability and methodological issues, PRIMAP-hist dataset does not include emissions from land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF). Non-CO2 emissions are expressed in CO2 equivalents using 100-year global warming potential values from IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.","Multiple scenarios are available by PRIMAP-hist. Climate Watch presents HISTCR where country-reported data are prioritized over third-party data, extrapolated data using AR4 GWP values.<br><br>When using this dataset or one of its updates, please also cite the data description article (Gutschow et al., 2016, http://doi.org/10.5194/essd-8-571-2016). <br><br>""The v2.4 release of PRIMAP-hist reduces the time-lag from 2 to 1 years. Thus we include data for 2021 while the last version (2.3.1) included data for 2019 only. For energy CO2 growth rates from the BP statistical review of world energy are used to extend the country reported (CR) or CDIAC (TP) data to 2021. For CO2 from cement production Andrew cement data are used. For all other sectors and gases no emission estimates exist. Thus PRIMAP-hist relies on numerical methods and uses a linear extrapolation based on the last 15 years. COVID-19 has primarily impacted energy related emissions and in tests with CRF data no impact of COVID in the performance of linear extrapolation of emissions data in the other sectors has been detected.""",Global,1850-2021,Annual,Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"Gütschow, J.; Pflüger, M.

For example, emissions data for Russia are not available prior to 1990. To generate a more complete and useful time series we have estimated emissions for Russia prior to 1990 first by using data from BP back to 1985, then by assuming that the share of Russia’s emissions in the USSR was constant up until 1985. Countries whose data are affected by this estimation method are listed on ""Methods"" section of http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/en/CO2-emissions , and their data in earlier periods must be considered to have significantly higher uncertainty.",Climate Watch displays only territorial CO2 emissions.
